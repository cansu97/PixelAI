# To use this rosinstall
# in your workspace src folder (let's say ~/nao_ws/src) do: 
# wstool init .
# wstool merge <this_file>
# wstool up -j8
# Then make sure you have all dependencies:
# cd <your_workspace>
# rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y
# Everything went fine? compile! 
# catkin_make
# Before launching you must install the meshes...
# Go to nao_meshes_installer and execute the last version for your platform
# In my case: ./naomeshes-0.6.7-linux-x64-installer.run
# You'll get a window asking you stuff, like where to store it
# You must store it in your workspace (so it extract directly inside of 
# nao_meshes directory. So you'll get nao_meshes/mesh/V40 directory structure)
